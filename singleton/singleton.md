# Singleton

## Definition

Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that there is one and only one instance of an object. An access point to the instance is globally provided throughout the application.

## Motivation

There are use cases where it is essential that that only a single instance of a class shall exist in the system, this will by design be guaranteed by the Singleton pattern. The one instance will be easily accessible since it is globally available. It is ensured that additional instances of the class can not be created by mistake.
